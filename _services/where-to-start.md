# Why do we need to have a ceremony anyway?

The wedding ceremony is an opportunity to perform all of the statutory requirements of a marriage under the *Marriage Act 1961*. This could be done with the two of you, your two witnesses, and a celebrant in less than ten minutes, or it could be done in front of hundreds of your friends and family – it is entirely your decision.

## The Paperwork

### Notice of Intended Marriage

The first form must be completed at least one month before your wedding ceremony, and no more than 18 months before your wedding ceremony. It is the start of the formal process of marriage, and if there is any delay, we can simply complete a new copy of the form after 17 months.

### Declaration of No Legal Impediment to Marriage

This form is completed shortly before the wedding, and it is the formal certification that you are both able to marry.

### Marriage Certificates

During the ceremony, three copies of the ceremonial marriage certificate are signed. One is obviously for you, one is kept in my records, and the last one is forwarded to the Registry of Births, Deaths, and Marriages.

Once the Registry of Births, Deaths, and Marriages registers your marriage you can (and should) order a copy of the registered marriage certificate. This is different from the one you sign on the day because it can be electronically verified when applying for passports, bank accounts, and so on.  

## Determine the Structure of the Ceremony

The minimum requirements for a wedding ceremony are surprisingly short. I am required to identify myself as an authorised marriage celebrant, and the two of you as the people to be married, explain the definition of marriage under Australian law, you are required to make the legal vows in the form specified by the Marriage Act 1961, and we are to sign three certificates (along with your two witnesses). Other than that, the rest of the ceremony is up to you.

Almost all the traditional elements of a marriage ceremony that you may have expected to see are entirely optional. Some of the popular elements are listed below, along with some examples of what we could say during this part of the ceremony.

### The Welcome

The start of the wedding ceremony, where we welcome the guests.

#### For a Wedding where some family members have travelled from overseas to attend

**Celebrant:** Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today to celebrate the marriage of \[NAME] and \[NAME]. Thank you all for being here today, I know that you are all incredibly important to \[NAME] and \[NAME], but I would like to make a special acknowledgement of \[GUEST NAMES] who have travelled all the way from \[LOCATION] to be with us today.

####For an intimate Wedding with fewer than 20 guests

**Celebrant:** Dearest friends and family, thank you all for joining \[NAME] and \[NAME] here today as they commit to their new marriage life together. You are all amongst the most important people in their lives, and I know how important it is to them that you could all be here with us today.

### Words about Marriage

#### Where the couple wish to acknowledge the joining of two cultures

**Celebrant:** Today, we do not just join two people together in marriage, we join two cultures. \[COUPLE’S NAMES] are so lucky not just to have found someone who loves and accepts them, but they have also found someone who respects and appreciates their culture. Despite their different backgrounds, \[COUPLE’S NAMES] are committed to their new life together, and they look forward to raising children together who will brought up with an appreciation of the cultures of both parents.

#### Where the couple are both marrying for the second time and have children from their previous marriages

**Celebrant:** As many of you will know, this is not the first time that \[COUPLE’S NAMES] have been married. In joining together as a family, they bring together their children as well: \[CHILDREN’S NAMES]. I ask you now to commit to work together to create a loving home for all your children as you blend your families together.

### The Giving Away

The giving away is a traditional way to include your parents in the ceremony, and there are many different ways that we can bring this into the modern world, like so:

#### Where the Bride doesn’t wish to be given away but would like both parents to affirm their blessings 

**Celebrant:** Will \[parents of the couple] please rise? As we gather here today, I ask you now to affirm your blessings on this union. \[bride’s parents] will you welcome \[groom] into your family and bestow your blessing upon this marriage?  
**Bride’s Parents:** We will  
**Celebrant:** \[Groom’s parents] will you welcome \[bride] into your family and bestow your blessing upon this marriage?  
**Groom’s Parents:** We will  
**Celebrant:** Thank you all. May these blessings bring your families closer together as this marriage between your children begins.

#### Where the couple has asked for a community vow of support instead of a giving away

**Celebrant:** Instead of the traditional giving away, \[couple’s names] have asked for a community vow of support. If you agree to support them in their new life, please repeat after me: We, the greatest wedding guests of all time, swear to support \[couple’s names] in their married life together. We add our blessings to this marriage, and as we party the night away, we promise to make this wedding reception something to remember for as long as we all shall live!

### The Asking

The big moment. You know the one, from every wedding in every TV show and movie ever. Your chance to say those two little words in front of all your guests.

#### Traditional

**Celebrant:** Do you \[SPOUSE 1] take \[SPOUSE 2] to be your lawfully wedded \[TITLE]? To have and to hold, for richer or poorer, in sickness and in health, for as long as you both shall live?

**You:** I do

#### Humorous 

I promise to stop singing the Hamilton soundtrack quite so much.  
I promise to grow old together with you.  
I promise not to drink your drinks, even though I am thirsty and your drink is literally right there.  
I promise to love you.

### The Ring Exchange

#### Where both parties will wear a ring

**Celebrant:** For thousands of years, people have signified their marriages with an exchange of rings. These simple golden bands declare to everyone that our couple meets their life-long love for and fidelity to each other. \[BEST MAN], would you please produce the rings?  
**Celebrant:** \[NAME], please repeat after me: with this ring, I thee wed  
**You:** With this ring, I thee wed  
*\*places the ring upon their partner’s finger\**

#### Where only one party will wear a ring
**Celebrant:** Marriage is often signified by the wearing of a ring, however, this is by no means mandatory. In this marriage, \[NAME 1] has chosen to take a wedding ring, while \[NAME 2] has not. \[NAME 2], will you please place the wedding ring upon \[NAME 1]’s finger, as you both repeat after me: with this ring, I thee wed.
**Both Parties, together:** With this ring, I thee wed.

### The Presentation

At the end of the ceremony, you may choose to be presented to the assembled guests.

#### Option 1

And that brings us to the end of today’s ceremony. Ladies and gentlemen, family and friends. Please join me in congratulating for the very first time [PARTY 1 NAME AND TITLE] and [PARTY 2 NAME AND TITLE]!

#### Option 2
With that, the formalities are concluded. It is now my high honour and distinct privilege to pronounce you married. Congratulations, you may now kiss.

## Preparing the Script
When we begin to work together to develop the script for your ceremony, I will need to know a lot of information about you! Some of the questions that you should be prepared to answer include:

  - Stiff and formal?
  - Carefree and full of humour?
- How you wish to be introduced at the end of the ceremony
- What do you want to see included in your ceremony?
  - Do you plan to write your own vows?
  - Would you like me to make an Acknowledgement of Country?
  - Would you like to invite a traditional owner to perform a Welcome to Country?
  - Will there be any readings or music included?
  - Will one or both partners be given away or have some other blessing from their families?
- Are there any rituals you would like to include in the ceremony? Some possibilities include:

  - Jumping over a broom
  - Ring warming
  - Sharing of wine
- Are any guests coming from a particularly long distance that should be acknowledged? 
- Are there any children that will also be part of your new family to include?

## How to Make a Complaint
I would ask that you bring any misgivings or complaints to me in the first instance, but if you feel the need to make a formal complaint, you can do so by contacting the Marriage Law and Celebrants Section of the Commonwealth Attorney-General’s Department using the official form available from their website: https://www.ag.gov.au/families-and-marriage/marriage/complain-about-marriage-celebrant 

### Making a Complaint
Complaints must be made within three months of you becoming aware of the problem, and the receipt of your complaint will be acknowledged by the department in writing.

You can complain if a marriage celebrant has broken the rules in the:
- Marriage Act 1961
- Marriage Regulations 2017
- Code of Practice for marriage celebrants

Once your complaint has been received, the Attorney-General’s Department will review it to make sure that they have all the information they need, it has merit, and there is not a more appropriate government department to review the complaint (such as the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission or a state Fair Trading Body) and they may open an investigation.

They will not deal with a complaint when:
- it was not made on the approved form
- it is not about the solemnisation of marriage by a marriage celebrant
- it is frivolous, vexatious, misconceived, lacking in substance or is not in good faith
- the complainant does not have sufficient interest
- the complaint is not made within 3 months
- the substance of the complaint has been previously heard
- the complaint is the subject of other processes
- the complaint would more appropriately be dealt with by another body.

The Attorney-General’s Department will treat your personal information are required under the Privacy Act 1988 (Cwlth), the Australian Privacy Policy, and their Privacy Policy.

After completing their investigation, the Attorney-General’s Department will advise the complainant and myself of the outcome of the investigation. Possible outcomes could include:
- Formal warning
- Requiring me to complete further training
- Suspension of my registration as a celebrant.
- Deregistration

However, they generally only take disciplinary action where there is a serious or ongoing breach of the Marriage Act 1961 or the Marriage Regulations 2017.
