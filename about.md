Brad Peters is a Melbourne-based Australian Civil Marriage Celebrant. 

I set out to get registered to officiate marriages after one too many friends and relatives asked if I was able to perform their wedding. 

Apparently, I have big celebrant energy, and Iâ€™d love to be able to bring that to bring your dream wedding to life.

I've always treated weddings as Serious Business. 

As a young child, I served as pageboy at my uncle's wedding, and it was made **very** clear to me that looking after the rings was a big important job &ndash; I wasn't to lose them or give them to anybody else. Sadly, no one thought to explain to me that at a certain point in the ceremony, I would have to give them to the Celebrant or things would grind to a halt.
