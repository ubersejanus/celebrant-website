Are you looking to cover your bases in case your celebrant isn’t available on the big day?

Available for booking four weeks in advance of your ceremony.

If your celebrant has to drop out for some reason, I can step in to execute the wedding that you have already planned.

# Pricing

The On-Call Celebrancy package has a $100 retainer and $600 call-out charge.

- **Inclusions**
  - Initial virtual consultation
  - Confirmation of script acceptance 
  - Transfer of documentation
  - Wedding ceremony (2 hours - includes prep time and final consultation)
- **Add-ons**
  - Extra consultations: $50/hour 
  - In-person consultations: $50 callout

Pricing includes travel to venues within one hour of Bayswater, Victoria.

Travel elsewhere in Victoria may be charged by arrangement, and interstate travel will require you to pay for flights and one night’s accommodation.

## Next steps

Let’s have a chat! The more I know about you and your plans, the better I can help ensure that your day goes off without a hitch.

There are also some important details to discuss like the paperwork requirements you'll both need to know about as well.

## Changes, Cancellation, and Refunds

Booking dates can be changed free of charge, assuming that I am available on the new date. Any charges incurred for changes to flights or accommodation will be on-charged.

If a wedding is cancelled, the balance will no longer be due, but the deposit is non-refundable.

Where a couple wishes to switch celebrants before the wedding, refunds may be considered upon request.
