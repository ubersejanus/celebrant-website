## Next steps

Let’s have a chat! The more I know about you and your story, the better ceremony I can craft for you.

There are also some important details to discuss like legislated timelines and the paperwork requirements that you'll both need to know about as well.

## Changes, Cancellation, and Refunds

Booking dates can be changed free of charge, assuming that I am available on the new date. Any charges incurred for changes to flights or accommodation will be on-charged.

If a wedding is cancelled, the balance will no longer be due, but the deposit is non-refundable.

Where a couple wishes to switch celebrants before the wedding, refunds may be considered upon request.
