# Why do we need to have a ceremony anyway?

The wedding ceremony is an opportunity to perform all of the statutory requirements of a marriage under the *Marriage Act 1961*. This could be done with the two of you, your two witnesses, and a celebrant in less than ten minutes, or it could be done in front of hundreds of your friends and family – it is entirely your decision.

# The Paperwork

## Notice of Intended Marriage

The first form must be completed at least one month before your wedding ceremony, and no more than 18 months before your wedding ceremony. It is the start of the formal process of marriage, and if there is any delay, we can simply complete a new copy of the form after 17 months.

## Declaration of No Legal Impediment to Marriage

This form is completed shortly before the wedding, and it is the formal certification that you are both able to marry.

## Marriage Certificates

During the ceremony, three copies of the ceremonial marriage certificate are signed. One is obviously for you, one is kept in my records, and the last one is forwarded to the Registry of Births, Deaths, and Marriages.

Once the Registry of Births, Deaths, and Marriages registers your marriage you can (and should) order a copy of the registered marriage certificate. This is different from the one you sign on the day because it can be electronically verified when applying for passports, bank accounts, and so on.  

# Determine the Structure of the Ceremony

The minimum requirements for a wedding ceremony are surprisingly short. I am required to identify myself as an authorised marriage celebrant, and the two of you as the people to be married, explain the definition of marriage under Australian law, you are required to make the legal vows in the form specified by the Marriage Act 1961, and we are to sign three certificates (along with your two witnesses). Other than that, the rest of the ceremony is up to you.

Almost all the traditional elements of a marriage ceremony that you may have expected to see are entirely optional. Some of the popular elements are listed below, along with some examples of what we could say during this part of the ceremony.

# Preparing the Script
When we begin to work together to develop the script for your ceremony, I will need to know a lot of information about you! Some of the questions that you should be prepared to answer include:

- The date, time, and location of the ceremony
- Your names (both legal names and what your family/friends call you day-to-day)
- What title you both plan to take? (Bride, Groom, Partner, or Spouse)
- What is the vibe you envision for the ceremony? 
  - Stiff and formal?
  - Carefree and full of humour?
- How you wish to be introduced at the end of the ceremony
- What do you want to see included in your ceremony?
  - Do you plan to write your own vows?
  - Would you like me to make an Acknowledgement of Country?
  - Would you like to invite a traditional owner to perform a Welcome to Country?
  - Will there be any readings or music included?
  - Will one or both partners be given away or have some other blessing from their families?
- Are there any rituals you would like to include in the ceremony? Some possibilities include:
  - Handfasting
  - Candle Ceremony
  - Jumping over a broom
  - Ring warming
  - Sharing of wine
- Are any guests coming from a particularly long distance that should be acknowledged? 
- Are there any children that will also be part of your new family to include?
- Any other key people who need to be acknowledged?
- What is the story of your relationship?
- Will there be an interpreter at the wedding?

# Marriage Education Services

Pre-marriage counselling and education gives couples a range of skills and knowledge to build a lifelong marriage together. As you go through life’s ups and downs together, it will be important to have solid communication and relationship skills to help each other through the hard times. There are also special courses available to help navigate the added dimension and challenge brought to a marriage when there are children from a previous relationship.

For more information about the services and advice available for couples and families, visit the Family Relationships Online website at [www.familyrelationships.gov.au](https://www.familyrelationships.gov.au) or phone the Family Relationship Advice Line on 1800 050 321.

# How to Make a Complaint
I would ask that you bring any misgivings or complaints to me in the first instance, but if you feel the need to make a formal complaint, you can do so by contacting the Marriage Law and Celebrants Section of the Commonwealth Attorney-General’s Department using the official form available from their website: https://www.ag.gov.au/families-and-marriage/marriage/complain-about-marriage-celebrant 

## Making a Complaint
Complaints must be made within three months of you becoming aware of the problem, and the receipt of your complaint will be acknowledged by the department in writing.

You can complain if a marriage celebrant has broken the rules in the:
- Marriage Act 1961
- Marriage Regulations 2017
- Code of Practice for marriage celebrants

Once your complaint has been received, the Attorney-General’s Department will review it to make sure that they have all the information they need, it has merit, and there is not a more appropriate government department to review the complaint (such as the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission or a state Fair Trading Body) and they may open an investigation.

They will not deal with a complaint when:
- it was not made on the approved form
- it is not about the solemnisation of marriage by a marriage celebrant
- it is frivolous, vexatious, misconceived, lacking in substance or is not in good faith
- the complainant does not have sufficient interest
- the complaint is not made within 3 months
- the substance of the complaint has been previously heard
- the complaint is the subject of other processes
- the complaint would more appropriately be dealt with by another body.

The Attorney-General’s Department will treat your personal information are required under the Privacy Act 1988 (Cwlth), the Australian Privacy Policy, and their Privacy Policy.

After completing their investigation, the Attorney-General’s Department will advise the complainant and myself of the outcome of the investigation. Possible outcomes could include:
- Formal warning
- Requiring me to complete further training
- Suspension of my registration as a celebrant.
- Deregistration

However, they generally only take disciplinary action where there is a serious or ongoing breach of the Marriage Act 1961 or the Marriage Regulations 2017.
