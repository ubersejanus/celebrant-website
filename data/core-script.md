## Vows: The Magic Words

## Introduction

**Celebrant:** Good morning / afternoon / evening, my name is Bradley Peters and I am an authorised marriage celebrant. I am privileged to be here today to officiate at the marriage of \[Spouse 1's full legal name] and \[Spouse 2â€™s full legal name]. I also want to wish you much happiness in your future lives together.
Declaration

**Celebrant:** Do you \[Bride/Groom/Partner's name] and do you \[Bride/Groom/Partner's name] declare before me and your witnesses that you are free by law to be married to each other today?

**Couple respond:** Yes, we do.

## Monitum from the Marriage Act

**Celebrant:** Before you are joined in marriage in my presence and in the presence of these witnesses, I am to remind you of the solemn and binding nature of the relationship into which you are now about to enter.

Marriage, according to the law in Australia, is the union of two people to the exclusion of all others, voluntarily entered into for life.

## Vows

The Couple, one at a time, repeat the vows after the Celebrant:

**Spouse 1 (repeating after Celebrant):**

I call upon the people here present to  
witness that I \[Bride/Groom/Partner's name], take you  
\[Bride/Groom/Partner's name] to be my lawful wedded \[Husband/Wife/Spouse].

**Spouse 2 (repeating after Celebrant):**

I call upon the people here present to  
witness that I \[Bride/Groom/Partner's name], take you  
\[Bride/Groom/Partner's name] to be my lawful wedded \[Husband/Wife/Spouse].

## Ring Ceremony (optional)

The couple, one at a time, repeat after the Celebrant:

\[Spouse's name], wear this ring with all my love.

## Conclusion of Ceremony

**Celebrant:** You have both made the declarations by law. In front of your family/friends as witnesses, I have great pleasure in pronouncing you husband/wife/spouse and husband/wife/spouse.
