Brad Peters is a Melbourne-based Australian Civil Marriage Celebrant. 

I set out to get registered to officiate marriages after one too many friends and relatives asked if I was able to perform their wedding. 

Apparently, I have big celebrant energy, and Iâ€™d love to be able to bring that to bring your dream wedding to life.
