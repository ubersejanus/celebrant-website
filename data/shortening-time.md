Under normal circumstances, a couple must give at least one month's notice of their intention to marry. However, in some circumstances, you may be able to apply for special dispensation to get married sooner.

**THIS IS GENERAL ADVICE ONLY, YOU SHOULD CONSULT A SOLICITOR TO UNDERSTAND YOUR LEGAL OPTIONS PROPERLY**

There are only five reasons to apply to one of the [Prescribed Authorities](https://marriage.ag.gov.au/stateofficers/authorities) for a shortening of time:
1. Employment-related or other travel commitments.
2. Wedding or celebration arrangements.
3. Medical reasons.
4. Legal proceedings.
5. Error in giving notice

It is not up to the Celebrant to decide to grant a shortening of time, or even to apply for it to be considered. Once the Notice of Intended Marriage has been completed, you will need to get in touch with your preferred Prescribed Authority (bearing in mind that some authorities may require you to apply in person) to find out the next steps.

You will also need to provide evidence that you are unable to wait a month for one of the five reasons listed above. This evidence could include things such as letters of employment, travel documents, airline tickets, receipts of payment, letters from medical practitioners, court orders or letters from authorised celebrants. Any documents written in a language other than english must be accompanied by a certified translation made by a National Accreditation Authority for Translators and Interpreters accredited translator.

Your celebrant will need to provide you with a letter confirming that they are available to solemnise your marriage on the desired date in the event that the shortening of time is authorised.
