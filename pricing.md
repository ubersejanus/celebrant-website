# Changes, Cancellation, and Refunds

Booking dates can be changed free of charge, assuming that I am available on the new date. Any charges incurred for changes to flights or accommodation will be on-charged.

If a wedding is cancelled, the balance will no longer be due, but the deposit is non-refundable.

Where a couple wishes to switch celebrants before the wedding, refunds may be considered upon request.
